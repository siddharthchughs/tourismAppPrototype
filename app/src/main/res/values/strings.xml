        as well as corresponding questions, all of which have been conceived by experienced
        and highly qualified language teachers. This means that anyone who wants to become a better reader

        Portuguese is one of the many languages whose text corpora are included in
        Sketch Engine, a tool for discovering how language works.
        Sketch Engine is designed for linguists, lexicologists, lexicographers,
        researchers, translators, terminologists, teachers and students working
        with Portuguese to easily discover what is typical and frequent in
        the language and to notice phenomena which would go unnoticed without a
        large sample of Portuguese text.
